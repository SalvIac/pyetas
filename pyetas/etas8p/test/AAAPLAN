plan

- find a method to merge previous work (faults) with simulations (1-2weeks)

moving on:
- write conference paper

journal papers
(1) extend previous work + etas + merging problems
(2) extend previous work without etas, adding risk (multi-sites)
(3) extend (1) adding risk (multi-sites) with simple vulnerability

future work/papers:
- vulnerability models with aftershocks
- extend (3) with advanced vulnerability models

cool ideas:
- use ETAS results and/or ML to produce the area sources (see chu et al. 2011, kagan et al. 2010 for broad tectonics)
- use ML (DL) to simulate damage states with several (multi) IMs
- ETAS include a stochastic clustering procedure (it gives the probabilities for each event being a background event or a triggered event): this might be the key to explore the epistemic uncertainty of diffeernt source models (in the ERF)
- use seismicity to infer the location of the active faults? not sure it's possible but it's interesting and useful
- reinforcement learning to calibrate ETAS
